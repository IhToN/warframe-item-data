The fear gives me a strange perspective - I\u2019m out of my body. I\u2019ve forgotten how I got here. I don\u2019t recognize this place.\r\n\r\nDavis and I slam pinned against a cell door and he shouts at me. I give him a dumb look. I can\u2019t hear him, the sirens, anything, only the muffled throb of terror in my head. I turn away from Davis down the hall and I see it. The hulking mass, flickering red, glinting like steel and fresh blood. Its skin changes, flowing like mercury when I\u2019m blinded by the sudden muzzle-flashes. They do no good. The beast surges forward and the security men become crimson mist and gore.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a statue, a cornered animal. A gate opens inside me and recognition floods in. I have seen this monster before. I have cut its shell and eviscerated its brothers. I have given it pain and measured its response. I have crafted then rejected countless like it. But I\u2019ve never seen this beast so close, without the shield, without restraints. I have never seen it... free.\r\n\r\nI know I will die so I just watch with curious acceptance. The beast squats down, shovelling a heap of gore into its mouth. It is watching me with vague eyes, a sense of recognition, ancestral memory. It knows who I am and what I\u2019ve done. It rears up like a bear and roars, shattering the lights and casting us into darkness. I can hear it lumbering toward me, its metal fingers rending the walls, but I know I am dead. I close my eyes and stand ready to pay.\r\n\r\nI feel the pull on my arm and realize Davis got the cell open. He tugs me into the cell beyond and I fall on my back. I see Davis standing at the open door, waiting, as the monster tears towards us.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I could live through this so I shout, 'Davis, close the goddamn door!' - But he shakes his head with eyes wide as moons. He shouts, 'Watch!' over the roaring and rending of metal.\r\n\r\nThen silence. Davis is panting, laughing? The beast fills the doorway, inches from him, dripping in blood, but still without violence. It stands there, looking at its hands. Davis whispers, 'No one would have believed me.'\r\n\r\nI crawl up the wall to stand, opposite the door. I\u2019ve never seen this cell, a cold place with an array of shelves. A morgue? 'Where are we, Davis?'\r\n\r\n'This is where they keep them. The ones from Zariman.' I\u2019m thrown, what was the Zariman? The ship that never returned? 'Davis, what\u2019s going on?'\r\n\r\nDavis turns to me a smile forming - 'What's going on is...' he turns back to the beast now silent and calm. '...big, fat promotions.'",

Through my filthy porthole I saw stars among the outlines of the other Splinter ships queuing for the Solar Rail. It would soon grip us with an incomprehensible power and cast us through the void into the mouth of our enemy.\r\n\r\nI watched the ships one-by-one bending and gone. Each crammed with zero-tech soldiers sucking stale air, white knuckling their percussion rifles. Each filled with a desperation that comes from extinction. Our ship would be the last to cross the gap. Our ship had special cargo.\r\n\r\nIt was essentially empty. Just ten men, like me, strapped in with the best zero-tech suits and weapons the empire could build... and 'it'. 'It' stood in the aisle, a slender and eyeless metal form. A Tenno inside its Warframe. Vaguely human, vaguely feminine. Was this armor or some ornate carapace for the monster that lived inside? I strained against the harness as the ship yawed for final approach. I could see the Tenno standing there freely. Solemn and gold-gleaming, oblivious to the inertial force.\r\n\r\nI had been, until then, a Tenno denier. They were ghosts, propaganda, twisted casualties of the void era. Not possibly real. Yet here it was in the flesh. The Empire, in their desperation, was going to turn the demons loose and hope for the best. Who did we fear more, the enemy or this monster? We had our safeties off, could we trust it? Then it didn\u2019t matter anymore. The punch came - and our windows became blinding. When we could see again our ship was somewhere else, shattered and dead in an instant.\r\n\r\nMy lungs were flattened, eyes full of death. Ship debris glittered like a night snow. The alien blue star was dark and blinding beyond us. The countless articulating worm-ships of our enemy, ringed in glowing discs, undulating and heat-bursting the surviving soldiers like me. This is where I died. I was caught in R-disc, sweeping over my right side and setting my blood on fire. My vision flattened, the hearing muffled and buzzed. I could feel the side of my face going slack and wet.\r\n\r\nI was in a dying dream. I saw a bright spot blurring and weaving toward me. I felt a tug toward it from the metal clasps on my suit. It reached me, rising up - a gleaming metal beast, a plume of golden wings rising and unfolding behind it. An angel. It snatched me from my death. I could feel my lungs fill as it wrapped me in its wings. Its Void Shield shimmered blue, strained under the enemy beams. I felt a sudden tug of acceleration. I closed my eyes and held on like a child.\r\n\r\nI awoke on the floor, the sting of crisping flesh on my face and side. It was standing over me, the wings gone. I heard the cracking of weapons echoing down the corridor. Maybe the mission would be saved, but I was dying and so I waved my hand to send it away. I felt a pistol thrust in my hand as I was heaved to my feet. The angel had saved me, pulled me from hell, but it would not pity me. I was to die on my feet, by its side. I turned my good side toward the gunfire and raised the gun. It nodded, its outstretched metal hand surging and pulsing in ancient shapes as blue shimmered around me. It turned, drawing its blade and together we surged headlong into the hailstorm of death and fire that awaited us.",
